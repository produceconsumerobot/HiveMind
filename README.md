# HiveMind
Hive Mind is a peek into the future of augmented cooperative cognition. Pulses of light and sound synchronized to the brain rhythms of two performers create an immersive environment that transports the audience to altered states of consciousness. Based on neuroscientific research showing that rhythmic stimuli can entrain neuronal oscillations to alter perception, memory formation, and mood, HIVE MIND uses the performers' live EEG and data processing to directly convey the performers' brain states. As one performer's brainwaves become the stimuli that entrains the other performer's brain patterns, a public brainwave-driven conversation unfolds between the performers. Together the performers and audience go on a journey through different induced brain states and altered perceptions, ultimately considering broad implications for the future of human cognition and communication. http://produceconsumerobot.com/hivemind/
